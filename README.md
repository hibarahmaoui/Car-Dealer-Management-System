This project is a simple Car Dealer Management System implemented in C. It enables car dealers to efficiently manage their car inventory using a double-linked list data structure. The program provides functionalities to add, update, and delete cars, as well as search for cars based on various criteria such as Vehicle-ID, Make, Year, and Cost.Users can interact with the system through a user-friendly command-line interface. The program also supports data persistence by reading and saving car information to a text file, allowing dealers to keep track of their inventory across sessions. This project serves as a demonstration of dynamic memory allocation, linked list implementation, and user input handling in C programming.
